Hi guys,

My name is Thiruvenkat I am Pursuing my undergraduate degree in AI&ML.

I have used open CV techniques to create this project 

This model recognizes the vehicle number plate with 90% accuracy and displays that the number plate is detected on the screen,

This model can be implemented in real life to find theft vehicles in India and also for automatic booking cases against illegal violations of traffic rules!

I am currently working on this project to increase its accuracy and its applications as well!
